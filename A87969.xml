            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE Houses having this day received from their Commissioners a copy of your Letter to them, dated at <hi>Bedford July</hi> 29. with a Copy of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Letter of the same date, writ to the City of <hi>London,</hi> in both which though there be no accounts at all of the motion of your Army, yet the Houses understand by the Letters from their Commissioners in which the said Copies were inclosed, and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, that you have given Orders for the marching of the Army towards <hi>London,</hi> upon pretence of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending the Houses from the danger of Tumults;
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:160412:3"/>upon consideration whereof the Houses have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded us to let you understand, that as they cannot but have a deepe sence of the undue Libertie which some Apprentices of the City of <hi>London,</hi> and others, from whom they might have expected more obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, have taken to themselves to violate the just Authority, Priviledges, and freedome of Parliament, in which the safety of the whole Kingdome is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned and so they doubt not but the sense of so great an offence will at last strike all their brests that have been accessary thereunto, with a detestation of any practices of the like nature for the future, And as the Houses cannot imagine, That the disorder com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by some Apprentices, or those that ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with them; had the allowance of the City of <hi>London</hi> so they have since received full satisfaction by the strict Orders given out by the Lord Mayor, and Common-councell of the City to all Masters, to have care of their Servants, and by their Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on proclaimed in the severall parts of the City, for the preventing and suppressing of Tumults, that they shall sit with much freedome and security, for the preventing and suppressing of Tumults, that they shall sit with much freedome and security from any distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance for the future. And therefore the Houses see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no cause to Command that Army; or any part thereof to march up for their defence, but rather judging (by the distractions raised at the newes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of) that the motion of the Army near the City, is like to precipitate the City and Army in a desperate and bloodly ingagement, not onely to the disturbance of the Parliaments sitting, but also to the distruction thereof, and of all Authoritie, by casting the whole
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:160412:3"/>kingdome into confusion. For prevention thereof, they have sent you this inclosed Order, requiring you as you tender the freedome of Parliament, the safety of the City and whole Kingdome, to give exact o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience thereunto; this being all we have in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, we rest.</p>

               <salute>Right Honourable,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THE Generals head-quarters are yet here at <hi>Colebrooke,</hi> but this day they are intended to march to a Rendezvouz at <hi>Houn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slow</hi> Heath, part of the Horse are gon over into <hi>Kent,</hi> of the Generals owne Regiment under Major <hi>Desborrough,</hi> the other part are in <hi>Essex,</hi> those (we heare) have seased on the Fort at <hi>Tilbury,</hi> called the Block-house; as for the Block-house at <hi>Graves-end,</hi> that we heare is not much tenable and of little use to be kept, except it be guarded when taken.</p>
            <p>The King is resolved to remove from <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timer</hi> to a house nearer <hi>Windsor,</hi> which his
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:160412:4"/>Majesty hath made choise of, and I suppose will not be denyed him,</p>
            <p>The Army hath contracted their Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quarters closer, out of the severall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties where they were quartered; the last be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now come up, and (I suppose will be at the Rendezvouz this day on <hi>Hounslow</hi> Heath.</p>
            <p>This night it is to be resolved, by a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of warre what shall be done in matter of advance against the City, when to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach and where.</p>
            <p>There is no Answer sent from the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall or the Councell of Warre, to the Letter from the Parliament, by reason that they doe not take notice of the Houses sitting.</p>
            <p>I am sorry to see things so high.</p>
            <p>I am grieved at the very heart to see the eminent dangers hanging over us, if God divert not the deluge of blood threatning us.</p>
            <p>Collonel <hi>Tuleday</hi> had notice that Sir <hi>Samu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el Luke</hi> was at his house at <hi>Cople</hi> in <hi>Bedford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire,</hi> nere <hi>Bedford,</hi> and thereupon hee sent out a party of his Regiament thither, who as we heare, have taken him prisoner.</p>
            <pb n="5" facs="tcp:160412:4"/>
            <p>Divers Members of both Houses are with the Army, &amp; more with the Head-quarters.</p>
            <p>The Councell of Warre have had some debates about a Declaration, but as yet it is not concluded. I heare they are intended to summon the City of <hi>London</hi> first, but the truth is (I suppose) it is not fully resolved by the Generall and Councell of Warre in that particular.</p>
            <p>The printed Declartion from the City of <hi>London</hi> was yesterday brought to the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, and read at a Councell of War.</p>
            <p>The Lord <hi>Lotherdale</hi> (one of the <hi>Scots</hi> Commissioners) is put away from the Court not being admitted to the King, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he went from <hi>Owburne.</hi>
